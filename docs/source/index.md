# SpacialComassV(SCOMV)

**SCOMV** is a computational framework for the analysis and visualization of spatial transcriptomics data.
It represents the spatial distribution patterns of cells and genes relative to a user-defined reference region (e.g., tumor regions) using vector-based features derived from their spatial relationships.
These representations enable the unsupervised classification of spatial expression patterns without requiring prior biological annotations. Reference regions are delineated using [SpatialKnifeY (SKNY)](https://skny.readthedocs.io/).


By integrating information across multiple fields of view, SCOMV further identifies spatially differential genes (spatial DEGs) that exhibit region-specific spatial reorganization beyond conventional differential expression analysis.

It builds on top of [scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [anndata](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), from which it inherits modularity and scalability.
