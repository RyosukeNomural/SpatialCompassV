# SpacialComassV(SCOMV)

**SCOMV** is a computational framework for the analysis and visualization of spatial transcriptomics data.

It represents the spatial distribution patterns of cells and genes relative to a user-defined reference region (e.g., tumor regions) using vector-based features derived from their spatial relationships.Reference regions are delineated using [SpatialKnifeY (SKNY)](https://skny.readthedocs.io/).

By integrating information across multiple fields of view, SCOMV further identifies spatially differential genes (spatial DEGs) that exhibit region-specific spatial reorganization beyond conventional differential expression analysis.
