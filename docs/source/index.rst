SpatialCompassV (SCOMV)
======================

**SCOMV** is a computational framework for the analysis and visualization of spatial transcriptomics data.

It represents the spatial distribution patterns of cells and genes relative to a user-defined reference region
(e.g., tumor regions) using vector-based features derived from their spatial relationships.
Reference regions are delineated using SpatialKnifeY (SKNY).

By integrating information across multiple fields of view, SCOMV further identifies spatially differential genes
(spatial DEGs) that exhibit region-specific spatial reorganization beyond conventional differential expression analysis.
